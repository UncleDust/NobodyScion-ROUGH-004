AUTO SYMBOLISM, EVOCATION, INVOCATION, PETITION

'The Lucky and Strange Shot' - This gives the Nobody his first symbol to use
auto-symbolically --the rabbit. 

Possibly, one symbol suitable for auto-symbolism operations per specific
one-shot created for just this purpose? Maybe, a few to choose from per 
campaign? With the Lucky and Strange Shot being the introduction to this
dynamic.
