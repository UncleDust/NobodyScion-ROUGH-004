LEVELING AND ADVANCING

Ultimately, Objects, events, Tableuxs, & Encounters turn into larger constellations of 
meaning that produce maxims which are moments of insight and clear understanding.
Each of these INSIGHT MOMENTS allow the player to climb their respective ladder
to their respective version of ENLIGHTMENT and opening new abilities and attribute
ratings. 

Sometimes progress is triggered via
	conversational
	behavioural
	attitudinal
behaviors on the part of the Player and not just task/mission/quest oriented. This usually, but
not always, comes from or is the result of a MAXIM. As a matter of fact, conversations and the
ability of the player character to get/take/cajole/glean what they need is _very_ important. 
People are like buildings in the world of the Nobody & Scion. They are meant to be both
inspected and explored, and, if found worthy, purchased, enjoyed, utilized, and improved.
