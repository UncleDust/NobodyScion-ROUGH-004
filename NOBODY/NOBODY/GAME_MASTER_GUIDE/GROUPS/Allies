Allies

These folks also subsist off the emotions of others, but it isn't like the act of eating to them. 
It's more akin to listening to beautiful music or watching the play of sunlight across shimmering

producers of this energy. 

MUNDANE

Helpers

The Nobody has a natural affinity with members of the following subcultures:

Hackers
Magicians
Philosophers
Artists
Underground / Street Culture
Mystics (sometimes even ordained clergy of religious denominations)

Collectively the above groups are informally called the _COGNIZATI_.

There are also MENTORS and PATRONS. Both offer friendship, moral 
support, information, and instruction. While a MENTOR can occasionally
help with an object or tool, PATRONS also offer material and financial
support.
