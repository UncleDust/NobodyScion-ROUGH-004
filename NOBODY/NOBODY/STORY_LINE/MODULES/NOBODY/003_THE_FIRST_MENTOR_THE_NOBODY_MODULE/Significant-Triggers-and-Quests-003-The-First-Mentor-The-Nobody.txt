SIGNIFICANT AND TRIGGERING EVENTS

TOWN VISIT
Multiple town visits? 

First visit we meet the VETERANARIAN (and the assistant?)

Meet town shopkeep

Meet Gas Station Attendent

THE CHICKEN COOP

Uncle Joe teaches the Nobody how to hypnotize a chicken (line in dirt causes 
tonic immobility)

THE SLAP

Uncle Joe is slapped across the back of his head by an invisible hand. The MONSTER?

THE ATTACK ON THE CHICKEN COOP
The Monster gets at the chickens. All are dead with feathers and blood scattered; a 
rib cage and claws. Uncle Joe blames the coyotes, but something is wrong on a succesful
awareness roll.

THE SIGHTING IN THE HALLWAY
The first sighting of the Monster is by the Nobody while sleeping. It is in the hallway. 
A large black presence. The sillouhette of a being. A shimmer of black sparks and it is 
gone. 

THE MISDIRECTION TOWARDS THE WRONG ANTAGONIST
The problem with the antagonistic neighbor is a feint and misdirection. It's actually
the effects and manifistation of a non-localized demon / monster aggroing the antagonistic
neighbor and in-town ferals. The monster and it's demonic effects has been summoned
by the super-wealthy neighbor that "has nothing to gain from doing something like this. 
There's no oil or grazing lands here."

THE TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS
The horrible accident on the highway is how we meet the antagonistic neighbor. He's hiding
something. Did he cause the accident that killed or harmed this person? Is it that he hunts
somewhere he wasn't supposed to be? 

There might be at least three of these with the last one sending the Nobody into the Hospital
and into the Astral.

	One of the accidents involves the Town Veteranarian. This introduces the Veternarian
	Assistant that is helpful to the Nobody. 

The first accident happens on the way into town and includes an IRREAL encounter with a 
shopkeep that speaks of milk and how it "mends broken bones". [#NOTE This is the first 
description of IRREALITY so it must be infectious.] This should happen after the car accident
and be referenced by one of it's vicitms to the Nobody. Perhaps, a little girls says, "Milk."
before she passes out or something like this. 	

The second accident involves the town veternarian. 

The third accident involves the Milkman. 

QUESTS

			MUNDANE

THE DEER HUNT
The deer hunt "With exploded, bloody, striped pillows and their scattered feathers"
rabbit? - 

THE LUCKY AND STRANGE SHOT
'The Lucky and Strange Shot' - This gives the Nobody his first symbol to use

THE JAVELINA HUNT
A build up and experience that ends in an injury that sends the NOBODY into the ASTRAL.

			SUPRAMUNDANE
THE SHRINE
First Visit
[#NOTE TBD reason for first visit] "They need more room for the dump and they have to 
tear down the Shrine. It's okay. They're going to move it down the road."

A DEFENSIVE WARD
The Nobody gets the first half of a defensive ward from the Parish Priest.

The Nobody gets a magical tool and the second half of another. 
	A defensive ward (second half). 

A DIVINATION METHOD

THE CHURCH
A PURIFICATION RITUAL
A discussion of a past magical battle. 

THE MONSTER
The Nobody has his first lucid dream / astral encounter with the MONSTER. The _curandero_
(and town feral (maybe, one of the car accident victims)) reference it (before? after? both.) The
drips lay down a DAMPENING FIELD that sends him ill and  towards the JAVELINA HUNT 
and then into the ASTRAL.
