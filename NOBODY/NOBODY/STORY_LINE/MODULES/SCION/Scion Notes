The short stories about the Scion should be told through the eyes of the characters around her exclusively. Nothing is told in first person "Scion".

Possible title and set-up: THE SCION WORKS WITH A SPACE-AGE CULT TO TAKE DOWN THE 
NOBODY!

Because of her sheltered existence and insatiable curiosity the Scion enjoys film, television, books, and magazines (all forms of mass media) during her time at The Orchard and later at The Academy. She begins to arrive at a non-traditional execution of her ancient role that involves mixing her inherited psychic powers & Aristoi spycraft with tools of mass media and the fulcrums of weaponized psychologies.
