000.1 The Scion Modules - The Orchard

[#NOTE: Nerf the Scion a bit. Her powers are softer, tenous, 
intermittent along with her puberty. She feels she is going mad
sometimes? "Imagine a language that can't be translated into
any other language. We know what it's saying, but we can't 
decrypt, unpack, explain, or otherwise, easily, transfer the
information." "It's like being trapped inside of a prison inside
of a prison."]

[#NOTE: She needs a classmate --a friend. Just one.]

The Shoreline

Sitting
on a small
blue and white
striped towel
staring down
into a pool of saltwater
left behind
by
the receding tide.

She was waving
one of her arms
around the pool
and
something
left behind
by the ocean
was swirling
inside of it.

A wave would
roll over
a sand bar
increasing its spin
and,
when it rolled out,
drag a bit more
of the pool’s water
back into
the sea.

The carcass of
the pelican
made her feel
funny on the inside
and
it was
her attempt
to understand
this feeling that
pinned her
in place
watching it
pirouette
at the center of
the hole
before her.

In its lifelessness
the pelican
was
doing
a slow
dance.

Its wrists and neck
bending gracefully
as it spun,
and,
in its death,
it was as beautiful
as its companions
that floated by
in rows of
two,
three,
and
four
above
her.

Maybe,
even
more
beautiful.

She admired
its wings
–the tips of their feathers,
symmetrical and spreading;
synchronized
with its neck
and wrists.

But,
she was
most affected
by the
large pouch
attached to
its lower beak.

She thought of
how
it had been alive
and
now
it floated
in this pool
before her.

She wondered
if she had
seen it
flying by
before today
or
if it had
flown here
from far away
only to die
on this long stretch
of shoreline
that was
her backyard.

She thought about
her own death
and how
all things
die;
the fact that
this struck her
as both
something
real
and
a lie
pinned her
in her place
and
she watched
the dead pelican
slowly
spin.


[# 1971]


The rental car at the airport. The Imperial Le Baron. It 
was good to be able to stretch out after the cramped
airliner. The seats were orange and yellow vinyl. He 
found himself unable to appreciate the new style. The
interior of the rental car was black and shiny. 

He drive down the highway.

Then there was old town with its small familiar buildings
made of brick. 

That church. 

Then there was more highway until the brick wall, the 
wrought iron 
gate. 

Past the gate and Into the orchard. 

The Orchard.

Pull into the parking lot; inhale deeply. 

Soft crunch of loose gravel.

Another thin lozenge of 
nicotine gum (he has a colleague in pharmaceuticals in 
Sweden) and another deep inhaltion of the salted air and
finds that he is sitting at a table inside the house of Herbert 
Goodman, the adminstrator of this grove of trees, their 
buildings and all contents therein. Most important among
these contents are his juvenille charges.

	HERBERT GOODMAN

 He is a combination of Aristotle and Robin Williams. His psychic defenses 
are his bigest trait due to the poltergeist effects on the part of some of the 
naturals (most significantly the Scion). 

"She's a great girl. Really spectacular in every single way. She's young and 
she's got a long way to go, but we're optimistically hopeful that she'll be 
able to measure up. There is one thing though she can tend to be a little...
that is...[#fatalFlaw]."


Across the table from them are two of the staff; one, an instructor, the
other serves as floor mother the Scion lives on. 

"We rely o those who came before us."


	THE INSTRUCTOR

The instructor is a small man with pale freckled skin, wavy red hair and 
a prominent nose. He wears a sweater vest, corderoys, and reading 
glasses hang around his neck. 

"She has the demeanor of a girl twice her age. She's speaks and has the 
manner of a teenager instead of the child she still is. In addition to this, 
as we have already discussed, she is naturally gifted and performs on par
with adults in many ways apropos to our areas of concern. But, because
of this physical and psychic maturity I  must reiterate that it is easy to 
forget she is still very much a child in her intra-psychic and social 
development. Of particular note is...[#physicalShortcoming]"


	THE FLOOR MOTHER

"It's bothersome having to always be on guard around such a young child.
If I'm not vigilant at all times she is able to walk up silently --I cannot feel her
approach [#Targeted Sensory Perception Dampening ]. In other instances 
she  has intruded my thought stream (past my casual defenses) and giggled 
before breaking off[#mindreading #intrusiveThought]. On one occasion she 
scolded me for having what she deemed a 'strange' dream. [#DreamPeeping ]. 
I've been around her and her entire set of classmates for the last 8 years and 
there's something that you should be aware of...[#Secret]."

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

He has decided to leave the car behind and make his way through the grove 
towards the inner wall. He smiles at the guard and enters the Academy grounds 
with it's irregular clusters of white buildings, gardens, the clock tower. 

The familar sounds of the ocean clearly audible now.  The perfect lawns, the
breeze, the bright and clean sunlight. According to the clock tower classes were
in session and other then the occasional administrator or groundskeeper he 
had the walk to the stairs completely to himself. 

He stared out into the ocean from this high vantage point. The gulls sailed by
and he could make out terns running across thin foam, pebble-strewn shoreline. 

He can't see her. He wants to see her. But, there is a new sand wall between him
and the far end of the beach. His leather soles scratch their way down and half
way down he sits, removes them, and lays them to the side. 

He is on the beach and approaching the sand wall. Soon he will be with her. 

*HELLO, JONATHYN. HERB SAID YOU'D BE ARRIVING TODAY. * 
[#telepathy, #sensePresence]

He is still walking and smiles inwardly and sends it towards her. 

*I'M RIGHT OVER HERE.*

He has turned the corner and she is standing over an open pit filled with water left
over from the last high tide. There is kelp and her towel. 

*HOW'S IT GOING, KIDDO? I'VE MISSED YOU.*

She doesn't turn her head and she is staring into the pit and she is waving her hand in
tight circles. The corpse of an albatross swirls before her. 

*AH. FEELS WEIRD.*

*YES.*

*LEAVE THAT ALONE. COME HERE. I'VE BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING."

And he kneels down and snaps the springs of his briefcase open. 

And she turns and leaves that thing alone and walks towards him.
