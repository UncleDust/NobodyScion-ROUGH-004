THE IN-BETWEEN

WHAT IS THE IN-BETWEEN?

The in-between is the space that lies between the wild and the civilized --the natural world and the man-made
one.

This space is physical because it is what we move through. But, in actuality, the in-between is nowhere. 

The in-between is the space between reality and irreality.

We are material beings made of flesh and bone. We  move through time from conception, infancy, childhood,
into adulthood before finally dying and returning  to the dust. 
We call this experience of rate...time. 
Because of where man is located in relation to a star we experience the divisions of seasons, days, weeks,
months, years, minutes, hours, seconds, etc. 

The in-between is beyond the man-made divisions of time, but it is also beyond the seasons and the movements
of the stars. 

Time does not exist in the in-between. 

The in-between is a god-realm. 
The in-between is extra-dimensional. 
The in-between is a source of our human and material existence. 
The in-between is experienced beyond the mundane senses, 
by the intuition, imagination, and emotions. 

An In-Between can be either ENTROPIC or CREATIVE.

On the Qabalahistic TREE OF LIFE it would be the SEPIROTH  of YESOD.


WHAT CAN THE IN-BETWEEN DO?

A localized Demon Field is a lesser type of Demon Field and is associated with an entropic 
in-between location.

WHEN WAS IT CREATED? 

WHO CREATED THE IN-BETWEEN AND WHO RULES THERE? 

The god Mars was originally an agricultural god. Imagine you are ancient man and you're 
praying to this god that you've assigned (for one reason or another) to the role of rain,
a good harvest, and to keep the animals away. Then a group of strangers comes to take 
your food by force. Who are you going to ask for aid? It works. You win and your societyt
becomes more advanced and prosperous. Aren't you going to reassign him as you begin to 
understand him more? 

Venus. The Romans stole her from the Carthagninans when she responded to a bribe and defected.
The Carthaginians stole her from the Phoenicians and they got her from the Babylonians. Who 
knows where they got her from.

My point is the Gods represent the forces of the world and our own minds. It's all about 
investigating, discovering, and adapting in response. This was something that our ancestors
discovered out of neccesity and technological circumstance and that we have forgotten and 
neglected for the same reason.
