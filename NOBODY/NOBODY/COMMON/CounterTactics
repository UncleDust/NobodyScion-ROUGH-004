HUMOR AS A COPING MECHANISM



MAGIC 
	Wards (of limited use depending on level)
	Banishing (of limited use depending on level)

#the longer an advesary is around the stronger the CONNECTION, it
is always a good tactic to deal with an advesary quickly and the best
reaction is to make judgements at a distance and prevent the
CONNECTION from being ESTABLISHED in the first place. 

HUMOR AS A BANISHING RITUAL

Remember: they have factions made up of individuals. Individuals can be influenced to work 
against their own faction if it serves their own best self-interest and factions can be influenced
to do the same for the same reasons. 

Don't let demonic admonishments scare, impede, or distract you in any way. But, at the same time, don't lose a cultivated, constant, and balanced awareness of their possible validity 
either. Sometimes an enemy is a free and best source of weak points and areas needing 
improvement or attention. 

STRATEGIES
1) Degrade, stop, remove damaging object
2) Stop damaging effects
3) Restore and/or replace damaged areas and systems	

Memory Wiping 
A way to erase trauma, but it causes loss of skills, abilities, 
tools, artifacts, etc. (The law of recipricocity, exchange, equivalency,
etc.)

Feral Wrangling
You can control and query unless you fail they: 
	attack 
	beacon for nearby ferals
		in proportion to the failing technician's level
		and any modifiers (tools, barriers, banishments)
		areas will have 'saturation' ratings 

IDENTIFY
Positive Positive
False Positive
False False
Positive False

After an adversary has been propery identified what are some countertactics:
Passively Ghost
Subtly Evade
Minimize Interaction
Escape/Detach/Stay
Escape/Detach/Leave

Avoid Dangles! Always know what you want before an interaction. If it's too good to be true,
avoid it. It's a trap. 

CONSIDER THE SOURCE
Is this source trust-worthy?
Does this source have any authority? 
Does this source have any credentials or experience? 
Why _this_ message? Who is being served here? 

COUNTER-COUNTER TACTICS
The never ending cycle.
Anticipating moves
Thinking ahead.
The unexpected.
