TRAPS & HAZARDS

Just that...booby-traps that others set so that you injure or 
harm yourself in some way. Some examples are a bike with
no brakes, poisoned food, spiked drugs, oil on a walkway, 
easily overlooked obstacle set across a darkened path 
commonly taken at night, etc. 

There are also naturally occuring hazards.
