	"you never know" 
	GM's bluff
	still though, a valid emotional intensifier is done properly (i.e. 
	motivated)

"Blended" rolls
	Imagintion and Wisdom rolls are added together and the sum is
	used however the player wants for object identification rolls.

	OR

	The player can subtract from die and add to the other.
