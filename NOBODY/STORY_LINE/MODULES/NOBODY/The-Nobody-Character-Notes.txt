The Nobody Character Notes
file created: 12/19/2018

The nobody has to be seen as the type of person (in the early 
modules) that would easily fall for and be manipulated by the 
later tactics of the illuminati.

Character Arc: 
Artist --> Hacker --> Magician
WITH flaw, sin, shortcomings, quirks, etc folded in. 

The Nobody takes the path of the mystic before becoming 
an artist and the Scion doesn't.
