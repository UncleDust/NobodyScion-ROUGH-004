Dice Rolls

Hidden rolls

Dummy rolls
	some people dont like this
	"you never know" 
	GM's bluff
	still though, a valid emotional intensifier is done properly (i.e. 
	motivated)

"Blended" rolls
	Imagantion and Wisdom rolls are added together and the sum is
	used however the player wants for object identification rolls.

#Each of the attributes is a different polyhedral die?
