Adversery Types

You're either giving up energy to them (they feed off of negative emotions; fear, sadness,
confusion, anger, etc), but if you can turn the tables on them you are drawing mana off them. 
It's not an easy thing to turn the tables on them. 

Drips and Sirens are related.
Vampires, Demons, and Ferals are related. 


Non-Localized Demon Fields, Gods, etc are related. These are long-lasting GodForms that 
have a high number of worshippers and others that are aware of them. 

A localized Demon Field is a lesser type of Demon Field and is associated with an in-between
location. These are shorter lived GodForms with a small number of worshippers in a
geographically small area. 

The higher a particular attribute of the Nobody then the higher the chance and the number
of a particular type of advesary is attracted.

IRREAL ADVERSARIES

All IRREAL / SUPERMUNDANE / SUPERNATURAL ADVERSARIES are "possesed"
by a force, or field that controls, advises, and aids them. 

VAMPIRES are able to hide their alignment and cooperation with this
force or field because they have maintained enough coherence and 
humanity to pass undetected. 

DEMONS are still communicative, but can be considered inferior in 
social standing to vampires. They have maintained just enough
coherence and humanity to be disregarded as merely strange, 
obnoxious, mean, or silly.

FERALS have been completely overtaken by this force and their 
original personality has been burned out and replaced. Incoherent
and threatening they use simple words or nonsensical phrases to 
conduct TWILIGHT LANGUAGE attacks. The threat of physical violence
is always there.

		VAMPIRES 

Vampires can be difficult to spot because off all the types of advesaries they are the most well-adjusted to what is called our real society. They have jobs, families, positions of authority, but they are well aware of irreality and flaunt their success and position at the top of the illuminati heap.

							SQUISHIES

Squishies are the saddest of creatures. They are the very bottom of 
the pile; mentally deficient, emotionally inept, and physically they are ugly 
and out of shape and not supernatural. But, this is where their power lies. They 
are primarily used for ambience type attack patterns. That is they are used in 
conjuction with other advesary types.  pattern manifestation: talking loudly, 
dressing or hygiene is lacking, moving or dropping things loudly, anything that 
draws attention to itself and contrasts them with the environment --mostly, and 
this is a big one, they carry themselves with the air of a person that doesn't 
give a fuck about anyone but themselves. they are able to convey the impression 
that they are aware of themselves and their ugliness, but they don't care. on 
top of this their behavior insinuates that they consider themselves better than 
you. 

mechanics: players must make a save vs. frustration when in the presence of 
Squishies.

DRIPS - Are active squishies and are supernatural

pattern manifestation: Where a squishy will just sit or stand there a Drip will 
actively engage and attempt to interact with you. They are like a joker and 
vampire, but where a joker attempts to create a psychedelic effect and the 
Vampire creates a domination effect, Drips create a frustration effect via the 
ugliness mentioned above in the Squishy entry.

mechanics: player must make save vs. frustration while engaged and/or 
interacting with a Drip.

BOTH DRIPS AND SQUISHIES are 'ugly' people who act as though they believe 
themselves to be beautiful. (Personality is what's ugly and appearance is 
just it's outward manifestation here)

REAL ADVERSARIES

Some advesaries are able to fake irreal advesary status. This causes some problems for the Nobody. 

Criminals - This guys will steal from you. They'll help frame you. They'll attempt to manover you into incriminating situations. 

Police - Although, all institutions are controlled by the Illuminati, law enforcement and intelligence agencies et. al. are of particular concern.
	 homeless (and other CI)

Firefighters - Generally neutral. Will offer emotional and moral support, but no more. Generally, not in the employ of the Illuminati, but aware of their influence and steer clear. 

Hospitals - Generally neutral. Will involve police if they have to. Some hospital workers are in the employ of the Illuminati and some are not.

Libraries - Generally helpful, but some employees are Illuminati and antagonistic to the Nobody, some aren't. Again, just because someone isn't actively pro-illuminati doesn't mean that they resist in any way or will come to the aid of the Nobody. 

Churches - They are aware of the Nobody, but there are shifting alliances and schisms inside each organization. They fight and help the Scion and they help and hinder the Nobody. 

Honey-pots - mundane variation of sirens/succubus

Hackers and Hacking Groups -

Intelligence Agencies -

GENERAL COMMUNITY -
	 the unsuspecting bumbler
	the useful idiot

DOPPLEGANGERS (FAUX PROXIES) - 

# in general, the longer an advesary is allowed to stick around the stronger
the CONNECTION (psychic vampirism) becomes and the harder it is to deal 
with.
