MAXIMS

A reward is given with each revealed or imparted MAXIM.

Maxims get ratings. 
When the player embodies a maxim or lives up to it in some
way that rating goes up. 

Maxims are abstract OBJECTS.

It is possible that Maxims are abstract EASTER EGGS	that
have been created and hidden by that great Easter Bunny
God --K'bah Lin and it is Vlankoor hHut that lays down 
OBJECTS like some sort of wierdo Santa Claus. Okay, fine
they can both do each of these things, but the
above-mentioned are their primary modalities.

There are TAUGHT, TRANSMITTED, and UNCOVERED (_Termas_)
maxims. 

Maxims of the Game

"If anybody says anything about the Nobody they seem crazy 
and if he says anything about them, he does."



The Maxims of the Nobody

Uncle Joe:

"A Good Deed is its Own Reward."

"Love your neighbor. Serve a Higher Purpose. Live and let 
live and God help you if you don't let live."

"How you let people treat you shows others what they can get
away with."

Curandera: 
"It's a mind space --not a physical one." (referencing the impending relocation
of the Shrine)


The Maxims of the Scion

"No Good Deed Goes Unpunished"

"Don't sweat the small stuff. It's all small stuff."
