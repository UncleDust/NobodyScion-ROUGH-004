005 THE NOBODY MODULE - AMONG THE HACKERS

"When hackers explore it's without their eyes. When they fight they never 
see their weapons or the effects those weapons and afterwards, they are
strangers, still, to one another."

Also, among the magicians.It is the hackers that lead the Nobody toward
the occultists (in fact, there is considerable blending between the two)
and, by extension, the _COGNIZATI_.

Of course, there are ARISTOI infiltrators. Who knows who they are?
