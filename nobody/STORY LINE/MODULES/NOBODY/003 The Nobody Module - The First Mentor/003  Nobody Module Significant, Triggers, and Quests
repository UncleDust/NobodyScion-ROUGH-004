SIGNIFICANT AND TRIGGERING EVENTS

The Monster gets at the chickens. All are dead with feathers and blood scattered; a 
rib cage and claws. Uncle Joe blames the coyotes, but something is wrong on a succesful
awareness roll.

The problem with the antagonistic neighbor is a feint and misdirection. It's actually
the effects and manifistation of a non-localized demon / monster aggroing the antagonistic
neighbor and in-town ferals. The monster and it's demonic effects has been summoned
by the super-wealthy neighbor that "has nothing to gain from doing something like this. 
There's no oil or grazing lands here."

The horrible accident on the highway is how we meet the antagonistic neighbor. He's hiding
something. Did he cause the accident that killed or harmed this person? Is it that he hunts
somewhere he wasn't supposed to be?
