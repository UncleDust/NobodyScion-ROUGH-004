NOTES

They stop at the old man's house on the way to the ranch?

The Nobody is forced to kill a man here and this is his Achille's heel / Moses 
moment that the Scion (or someone else?) will use against him later on. 

Change the weather up: it's raining, it's blooming, it's baking, its windy, etc.

The reader is thrown off. They think its the antagonistic enemy, but after
the trip to the sanctuary and the _curandero_ they discover the neutral
neighbor is a magician that has summoned a demon that is spreading
mischief to the area in general and Uncle Joe and the Nobody in particular.

There are bits of foreshadowing about the Nobody's destiny during his 
interactions at:
	The Sanctuary
	With the Curandero
	With a town feral ("What are YOU doing here?!)
	And with the Demon/Monster.

Maybe, another house guest?

Uncle Joe is hurt or sick? 

phone calls from mother

that cinematic trick where you are looking at a place and are distracted by the scary sound
--look...and it's just that silly cat that's been running around here...then back at the original 
view and the Monster is just there...like a Monster.
