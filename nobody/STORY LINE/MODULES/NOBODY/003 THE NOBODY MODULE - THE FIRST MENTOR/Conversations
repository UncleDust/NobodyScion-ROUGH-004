MOM: You're great great great grandfather was a Texas Ranger. We don't know
his real name because someone in the family stole the grave marker that
had it along with the Ranger Star on it. But, he was a Ranger. This would 
have been back in the days when they were still going around alone or with 
a single partner. They would ride into a town that was completely lawless,
with whorehouses and too much crime and they would be given the authority
to do whatever they needed to uphold law and order. 

When he was a little baby he was kidnapped by the indians and they raised
him as one of their own. Now his mother got very sad about this and she 
went to a man that owned the biggest ranch in that part of Texas and 
because he was influential and connected he had some pull with the local 
band of Commanches. So, to make him help her she went to him and gave him
a very expensive saddle with lots of those silver conch shells on them. No, 
I don't know how she got it only that their family was well off enough to 
be able to give him the bribe. 

He agreed to help and he went off and found the Indians and the boy, but
there was an woman that had grown attached to him and considered 
him her own son now. The man wanted to keep the saddle with the conch 
shells and he was able to convince the tribe to convince her to give 
him the boy, but she made it a condition that the boy would come back
and live with her for a few months at a time and that's how he learned 
to be a cowboy and a scout at the same time and that's how come when he
got older he had a wife and mistress. He had grown accustomed to having
two women fight for his love and companionship.

MOM: "Your grandmother got into a fight with a witch in a nearby town. Her head
spun around and her tongue stretched down to her knees. She doesn't like to
talk about it."

THE STORY OF UNCLE JOE'S STAR SHAPED JAWLINE SCAR

Uncle Joe had been sent to the peninsula during the Korean War of the 1950s. One
day while his platoon was on patrol they were ambushed by the enemy and a
battle took place, during which most of his fellow soldiers were killed and he 
was shot in the face while engaging in hand-to-hand combat. 

He was left for dead and laid in the snow until he regained consciousness and 
crawled to a nearby field hospital. There they were triaging the wounded and 
dividing them into two groups. The first group was composed of soldiers that could
be saved and the second of soldiers for who there was no hope. My uncle was put
into the second group and someone even pulled a sheet over his eyes, but again he
got up and crawled over to the first group. Again, he was placed in the second
group and again he crawled back over to the first group. This time he was operated
on and survived. 

And that's the story of Uncle Joe's Star Shaped Jawline Scar. There were two other
stories that your mom shared about him. Although they were less stories and more 
by way of descriptive character sketches. 

Apparently, because he was a "lifer" he had been able to rise through the ranks of
enlisted men to the rank of Master Gunnery Sargeant, but had been busted down a 
few stripes for hitting an officer. He eventually regained those stripes. 

The second story was how his brother who was also a Marine didn't enjoy going out
with him to bars because "He always starts fights." Joe's response to this is that
he never started a fight without a valid reason and most of the family agreed with
this. Still though, he was known to have an uncanny propensity to justifiably 
express violence upon the deserving and persistent.

"Do you still talk to your [TBD Imaginary Friend Name]?" warm-heart chuckle, "Let's 
see now if I can remember correctly [TBD Imaginary Friend Description]. Was that
right?" [#Inner Voice instructs the player to tell him yes and also... Uncle Joe reacts.]
