LIFE POINTS: 
MANA  (MAGICAL LEVEL):

	USE:
	REALITY-BENDING (probability control; luck; hex;)
	ASTRAL TRAVEL (visit other dimensions; commune with the Gods)
	ENERGY MANIPULATION (DEFENSE, OFFENSE)
	WEATHER CONTROL (cloud busting, rain, tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons)

PSI-QUANTA (PSYCHIC LEVEL):
PSYCH LEVEL(Ability to persaude, manipulate, dominate, etc.):


LUCK: [A game mechanic called "Leap of Faith" (similar to "Go For Broke"?) influenced
by this LUCK state. Also, used on occasion for events of chance or probability or to skew
game-changing events in some way.


MENTAL/INTRA-PSYCHIC: 

This is the important part. This is base structure that determines game
play. The scores in each of these attributes is what affects the probability
of success for the supra-mundane elements of The Nobody and The Scion.

It is true that most people have the potential for psychic and/or magical
abilities in much the same way that it is true that the game of basketball
can be taught to anyone in an afternoon or two. But, the analogy must be
extended to its natural conclusion: there is a difference between high
school and college levels of competition, even more so between college
and professional. And yet, even at the highest levels of professional
competition there are only a small handful of "stars" and among these
an even fewer number of truly legendary players. 

The Nobody and the Scion are legendary level characters, but there are 
other equally powerful non-player characters and what less powerful 
characters lack in ability they compensate for in numbers and frequency.
defensive measures, and responsive triggers? 

CONFIDENCE:
The king of attributes that influences all others. It also influences 
atmospherically the interactions with the GM and players (i.e. the way the
GM frames and presents actions, encouragement vs. criticism).

Used for, among other things, MAGIC, ARTIFACT CREATION, and 
WORKING WITH GODFORMS.

 [#perhaps a FAITH attribute tied to CONFIDENCE in the same way 
IMAGINATION and DISCERNEMENT are for detecting and interpreting 
FOUND OBJECTS]

[#perhaps used to determine INITIATIVE after STEALTH and SURPRISE checks] 

If confidence becomes too high (a ratio that is out of whack with ability)
it will negatively effect their performance via a #TBD dynamic and
mechanic.

[#This might be best served with some sort of a rating along a spectrum
that runs from self-awareness to foolhardy]

CONCENTRATION: 
The ability to focus on an object of attention for an amount of time. This
also is the ability to filter out extranous stimuli and focus attention on 
the chosen object. 

	USE: 
	For ATTEMPTS vs. CHALLENGING ACTIONS 
	SAVING THROW vs. DISTRACTION

AWARENESS: 
This is similar to CONCENTRATION, but subtly differnent in that it is the
AWARENESS that one is concentrating on something. Without AWARENESS, 
concentration can easily devolve into trance or fugue. The subtypes of 
AWARENESS are: 

	1) Environment
	2) Self
	3) Other
	4) Transpersonal Situation

	USE: 
	RESPONSIVE TRIGGERS (e.g. AWARENESS OF DANGER, PRIZE, ADVERSARY)
	SAVING THROW vs. INTRUSIVE VOICE 

IMAGINATION:
(Lateral & Abstract thinking, analysic, interpretation,deduction, extrapolation, 
prediction, etc)

The ability to effectively interpret messages in found objects, tableuxs, events,
etc.

	USE: 
	To be able to effectively communicate (send, recieve, and decrypt) in 
	TWILIGHT LANGUAGE. 
	Interpret meaning of objects, events, and tableuxs.

Used to create (design and fashion) MAGICAL TOOLS, RITUALS, and ARTIFACTS. 

DISCRIMINIATION / WISDOM: 
The ability to tell the difference between mundane/real vs. super-mundane/
irreal in a way that leads to the proper interpretation of information
passed on by the environment or via a characters abilities (probably 
AWARENESS). Most importantly, it is the abilitity to discriminate between 
a beneficial and harmful thing or person.  This is also referred to as
'discernment' and is the ability to effectivelydetermine the status 
(advantageous / attacking)  of any found objects. This is also used to
determine the suitability of a found object in magical tool and artifact
creation.  Determining whether an encounter is of a friend or foe variety.

WILL (SELF-DISCIPLINE):
(psychological)

	USE: 
	To STRENGTHEN RESOLVE - SELF AND OTHERS
	To MORALE BOOST - SELF AND OTHERS
	This determines MANA and PSI CAPACITIES (SEE SECTION BELOW)

RESILIENCE:
(Resolve / Ego-Coherence / Psychological Integrity/Sanity) 
This is the ability to shield/mitigate against psychic and magical
attacks 
and
The ability to resist damage from psychic and magical attacks
and
The ability to recover from psychic and magical attacks

	USE: 
	To achieve CALM during meditation. 
	SAVING THROW vs. DESPAIR

COURAGE: 

CALM: 
(PSYCHOLOGICAL STEALTH LEVEL):


PHYSICAL ABILITIES:
The player choses (or rolls random) for 
	1) body type (ectomorph, mesomorph, endomorph)
	2) Height

These two things determine the following physical attributes:
	Weight
	Strength
	Agility
	Flexibility
	Endurance
	Reflexes
	Stealth

Hand/Eye cordination and Reflexes are a TBD combination of the mental 
abilities CONCENTRATION and AWARENESS with STRENGTH/ENDURANCE and AGILITY/
FLEXIBILITY respectively.

AGE is mostly determined by the module being played and PHYSICAL SHORTCOMING is chosen by the player. The Stage Manager will help you with both of this bits of information.
